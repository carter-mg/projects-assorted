230_Project_Main.nb is a class project where we modeled stellar lifetimes on Hayashi tracks, low/high mass evolution tracks, and a simple 3 body gravitational simulation. 

normalization.py is some code I wrote for my research. It simply takes flux data from APO TripleSpec .fits files and normalizes the curve. I have the dS* V927 Her in the code as an example, our most recent target.

phase_calc.py is some code I wrote for my research. It simply takes data from lightkurve (TESS/Kepler missions) and the date/time of variable star observation and finds the pulsation phase in days at the time of observation.
