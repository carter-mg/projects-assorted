# about

In the astrophysical research folder, you will find some relevant code and images of my diagnosis of V927 Her. It is a delta scuti class variable, and this Helium emission feature is really strange! We are phasing it up currently. 

Under rocketry, you will find some python and RPA items that I have used to help develop our hybrid system!
