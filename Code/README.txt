# about

In the astrophysical research folder, you will find some relevant code and images of my diagnosis of V927 Her. It is a delta scuti class variable, and this Helium emission feature is really strange! It has been phased and the optical spectral evolution of the H alpha feature will be uploaded.

Under rocketry, you will find some python and RPA items that I have used to help develop our hybrid system! Currently working on NASA's CEA and also writing a reduced version. OpenFOAM sims to be uploaded, as well as my own code I am working on.
